  ✔ edit views.py to show the form @done(20-03-28 08:12)
  ☐ figure out how to .save() data
  ☐ verify the model is admin registered


  Notes:
    1) ModelForm is the class we create in forms.py under app folder

    we create form fields inside this class

    name = forms.CharField()
    email = forms.EmailField()
    verify_email = forms.EmailField(label='enter your email again')
    text = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    The clean() method on a Field subclass is responsible for running to_python(), validate(), and run_validators() in the correct order and propagating their errors. If, at any time, any of the methods raise ValidationError, the validation stops and that error is raised. This method returns the clean data, which is then inserted into the cleaned_data dictionary of the form.
